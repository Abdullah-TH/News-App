         "content":"Genesis, Hyundaiâ€™s luxury brand, has revealed its first all-electric car. Itâ€™s called the Electrified G80 because, well, Genesis took the existing G80 sedan and is refitting it to run on electricity. The carmaker claims it will travel about 427 kilometers (roughly 265 miles) on a full battery.\nItâ€™s a very straightforward idea that pales in comparison to some of the truly exciting concept cars Genesis has shown off over the years, many of which are purported to be electric. Basically none of those progressive styling choices and daring ideas are coming across in the Electrified G80. Itâ€™s also not mold-breaking like Hyundaiâ€™s Ioniq 5 sedan or Kiaâ€™s EV6, both of which are built on the parent companyâ€™s new e-GMP electric vehicle platform.\nThatâ€™s obviously by design, as Genesis will try to sell customers on something that looks and feels more familiar. And the Electrified G80 will borrow a bit from the e-GMP â€” namely, the high-voltage tech that allows for fast recharging as well as two-way charging, meaning the G80 will be able to power all sorts of electric appliances. But itâ€™s unclear what other work Genesis put into the rest of the G80â€™s electric underpinnings, as the company has said itâ€™s saving the full e-GMP platform for its future electric SUVs.\nGenesisâ€™ first electric production sedan was debuted at Auto Shanghai 2021, and it will be sold in China, but Genesis says the electric sedan is also coming to North America. The car will be all-wheel drive and can make a 0-to-60mph run in under five seconds, and there are plenty of luxury touches, like a road noise-cancellation feature and a camera-aided adaptive suspension. But Genesis didnâ€™t otherwise share any specifications, pricing, or release dates.\nFitting an electric motor and battery in a car designed to run on an internal combustion engine may be cost-effective for the automaker up front, but it naturally leads to compromises that you wouldnâ€™t have to make if you created an EV from the ground up. Genesis has teased at some big ideas in the past with its electric concepts, but the luxury brand is clearly not going to try to realize them with the Electrified G80."

         "content":"As online publishers grapple with how to replace dwindling ad revenue and find new ways to bring in money, Reuters, one of the largest news organizations in the world, is using a strategy thatâ€™s been around for years and putting its online content behind a paywall.\nReuters.com draws 41 million unique visitors monthly, according to the company, but it has not charged for access like other news sites in its business-centric niche have done for some time. It will let users read five stories a month for free and plans to charge $34.99 a month for a subscription. Thatâ€™s a bit pricier than a sub to The New York Times ($18.42 / month) but closer to similar news organizations of its type, including The Wall Street Journal ($38.99 / month), which put its paywall up in 1996, and Bloomberg.com ($34.99 / month), which added a paywall in 2018.\nReuters said it generates half of its revenue from its largest client, the financial data firm Refinitiv, and also makes money from online advertising. The company says it has redesigned its website with a â€œprofessional audienceâ€ in mind and plans investment in segments like legal news and live streams of its events.\nHow online news is paid for has been the topic of discussion among publishers for years; online advertising doesnâ€™t bring in the level of revenue that print ads used to for newspapers, and publishers often have to rely on platforms like Facebook and Google to push their content to readers. Google has battled with lawmakers in Australia who want the search giant to pay publishers for their content. And amid renewed scrutiny of social media platforms and how they siphon ad revenue from news publishers, a bill introduced last month in Congress aims to give more leverage to publishers when negotiating with platforms for a share of ad revenue.\nWhile both Facebook and Google have initiatives that pay some publishers to license their content, for many news outlets online subscriptions are a major part of their revenue streams."

         "content":"For my grandmother, Valentina Rachman, leaving the USSR was a momentous and difficult choice. Making her way across Europe to a camp in Germany, and thence to a Displaced Persons ship to Canada, meant facing enormous danger â€“ including nearly being burned to death in an antisemitic arson attack in Poland â€“ and then starting over in a new country where she had few contacts and could not speak the language.\nBut even after she learned English and established herself and her family in Toronto, she continued to pay a price for leaving: she was utterly cut off from her mother, brother, cousins and other family in Leningrad. She didn't even know if they were alive. It was a decade before her phone rang and my father heard his mother cry out \"Mama!\" for the first time.\nI moved from Toronto to San Francisco to London to Los Angeles. Each time, the move has gotten easier. When I left London five years ago, I shipped over my books, my clothes â€“ even my appliances! (I bought voltage adapters.) I videoconference with my in-laws in London and Wales weekly on Saturdays, and with the Toronto bunch every Sunday. If I change my mind, I can always move back.\nWhen we talk about social media monopolies, we focus too much on network effects, and not enough on switching costs. Yes, it's true that all your friends are already stuck in a Big Tech silo that doesn't talk to any of the other Big Tech silos. It needn't be that way: interoperable platforms have existed since the first two Arpanet nodes came online. You can phone anyone with a phone number and email anyone with an email address.\nThe reason you can't talk to Facebook users without having a Facebook account isn't that it's technically impossible â€“ it's that Facebook forbids it. What's more, Facebook (and its Big Tech rivals) have the law on their side: the once-common practice of making new products that just work with existing ones (like third-party printer ink, or a Mac program that can read Microsoft Office files, or an emulator that can play old games) has been driven to the brink of extinction by Big Tech. They were fine with this kind of \"competitive compatibility\" when it benefited them, but now that they dominate the digital world, it's time for it to die.\nTo restore competitive compatibility, we would need reform to many laws: software copyright and patents, the anti-circumvention laws that protect digital rights management, and the cybersecurity laws that let companies criminalize violations of their terms of service.\nNew proposals from the UK Competition and Markets Authority, as well as the EU's Digital Services and Digital Markets Act and the US ACCESS Act of 2020, all contemplate some form of interoperability mandate - forcing the dominant platforms to open up the APIs they already use to let various parts of their own business talk to one another. These mandates are a great floor under interoperability, but they can't be the ceiling. That's because they would be easy for big companies to subvert: if a lawmaker forces you to open a specific conduit to your competition, then you can respond by moving all the interesting data away from that conduit. You're still providing a jack that competitors can plug into, but you've moved all the important stuff to another jack.\nBut with both mandates and competitive compatibility, a new equilibrium emerges. A tech giant that nerfs its mandated interfaces doesn't send the upstarts who relied on it packing: rather, it embarks upon a costly and chaotic arms-race, where those competitors use scrapers, bots and other tools to maintain the link between their users and the dominant platform's hostages.\nBig Tech companies (with the exception of Twitter) have objected to this. If we don't get a veto over who connects to our services and how, they say, how will we safeguard those users' privacy? They won't. And they don't. The rules that determine when someone is abusing your privacy should come from democratic deliberation: from law and regulation. How your data can â€“ and can't â€“ be used is too important to leave up to the whims of tech executives.\n2.6 billion people are locked up in Facebook's walled garden and that means that you very well might submit to being locked in alongside them. That's network effects. Once you're there, you might hate it, but you still stick around because you don't want to leave your friends.\nNetwork effects are why my grandmother's family stayed behind in the USSR. Low switching costs are why I was able to roam freely around the world, moving to the places where it seemed like I could thrive.\nNetwork effects are a big deal, but it's switching costs that really matter. Facebook will tell you that it wants to keep bad guys out â€“ not keep users in. Funnily enough, that's the same thing East Germany's politburo claimed about the Berlin Wall: it was there to keep the teeming hordes of the west out of the socialist worker's paradise, not to lock in the people of East Germany.\nMr Zuckerberg, tear down that wall."

Today proved once again that with the power of science and American ingenuity, nothing is beyond the realm of possibility,\" US President Joe Biden tweeted.\nThe six-wheeled vehicle will now spend at least the next two years drilling into the local rocks, looking for evidence of past life.\nJezero is thought to have held giant lake billions of years ago. And where there's been water, there's the possibility there might also have been life.\nThe signal alerting controllers that Perseverance was down and safely arrived at 20:55 GMT. In the past, they might have hugged and high-fived but strict coronavirus protocols meant they had all been separated by Perspex screens. A respectful fist bump was about all they could manage.\nNonetheless, the excitement was evident. And the applause continued when the first two images came in. They were taken by low-resolution engineering cameras. There was dust covering the still-attached translucent lens covers, but it was possible to see a flat surface both in front and behind the rover.\nPost-landing analysis indicated the vehicle had come down about 2 km to the southeast of the delta feature in Jezero that Perseverance plans to investigate.\n\"We are in a nice flat spot. The vehicle is only tilted by about 1.2 degrees,\" said Allen Chen, who led the landing team. \"So we did successfully find that parking lot and have a safe rover on the ground. And I couldn't be more proud of my team for doing that.\"\nSteve Jurczyk, the acting administrator at NASA, also saluted the achievement: \"What a credit to the team. Just what an amazing team to work through all the adversity and all the challenges that go with landing a rover on Mars, plus the challenges of Covid. Just an amazing accomplishment.\"\nMike Watkins, the director of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the home of the agency's Mars missions, added: \"There is something special about the first few days (of the mission) because we have just landed a representative of Planet Earth on a place on Mars that no-one has ever been to.\"\nThis is the second one-tonne rover put on Mars by the US space agency.\nThe first, Curiosity, was landed in a different crater in 2012. It trialled innovative descent technologies, including a rocket-powered cradle, that Perseverance has also now put to good effect."

While reports indicate that the new iMac will have a design similar to the Pro Display XDR and will also be available in more colors, this new concept from ConceptsiPhone and Khahn Design shows just that.\nInstead of having a curved body like the current generation, the iMac shown in the concept is completely flat â€” just like the Pro Display XDR. However, the body is much thinner than Appleâ€™s expensive external display and also has rounded corners, becoming more like the iPad Pro and the 4th-generation iPad Air.\nIt might have been hard to imagine a desktop computer as thin as an iPad a few years ago, but now, that becomes more plausible with Apple Silicon chips, which are more efficient and donâ€™t require huge fans. The idea of the concept is basically to have a giant iPad Pro attached to a simpler version of Appleâ€™s Pro Stand.\nThe first-generation iMac was introduced in five different colors, and recent rumors point to more colors coming to the new iMac â€” which is currently only available in silver. The iMac in the concept has five different colors, most of them based on the current iPad Air lineup: blue, rose gold, black, red, and green.\nYou can see more details of this concept in the video below:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8bJLynOExs\nAlthough Apple will hold a special event on Tuesday, itâ€™s unclear whether the redesigned iMac is coming now or later this year.

For the first time ever, Visual Studio will be 64-bit. The user experience will feel cleaner, intelligent, and action oriented.\nDevelopment teams have become more geographically dispersed than ever. Itâ€™s become apparent over the last year that organizations need their development teams to collaborate securely, deliver solutions more quickly, and continuously improve their end-user satisfaction and value. Weâ€™re making it easier to collaborate with better GitHub integration making it seamless to go from idea to code to the cloud.\nSpecifically for Mac, Visual Studio 2022 brings a whole new native macOS UI, improved performance and reliability, and can leverage all of the operating systemâ€™s accessibility features.\nLike the Windows version, Visual Studio 2022 for Mac will also come with the new GitHub integration.\nOur goal with Visual Studio 2022 for Mac is to make a modern .NET IDE tailored for the Mac that delivers the productive experience youâ€™ve come to love in Visual Studio. Weâ€™re working to move Visual Studio for Mac to native macOS UI, which means it will come with better performance and reliability. It also means that Visual Studio for Mac can take full advantage of all the built-in macOS accessibility features. Weâ€™re updating the menus and terminology across the IDE to make Visual Studio more consistent between Mac and Windows. The new Git experience from Visual Studio will also be coming to Visual Studio for Mac, beginning with the introduction of the Git Changes tool window.\nMicrosoft says those are only â€œa few highlights of our work in progress, but we welcome your initial thoughts on the direction weâ€™re taking for Visual Studio 2022.â€"

         "content":"Google is Google because of its lucrative advertising businessâ€”and that business works by letting advertisers target users based on what they do on the web. On Wednesday, Google announced what some observers have framed as a major shift in that setup: The companyâ€™s Chrome browser will soon stop tracking individual users across different websites in order to serve them ads. While the change does allow the web giant and its advertising customers to continue tracking users to a certain extent, this appears to be a significant step away from Googleâ€™s traditional model. David Temkin, Googleâ€™s director of product management for ads privacy and trust, described the decision as a move to address growing concerns about digital privacy. â€œPeople shouldnâ€™t have to accept being tracked across the web in order to get the benefits of relevant advertising,â€ he wrote in a blog post announcing the change. â€œAnd advertisers donâ€™t need to track individual consumers across the web to get the performance benefits of digital advertising.â€\nLast year, Google pledged to stop using third-party cookies, pieces of code that keep track of what users have been doing across the web, by 2022. These cookies, which websites deliver to a userâ€™s browser, are the reason banner ads for, say, humidifiers might keep popping up after youâ€™ve ordered one from an online retailer. The company had been exploring potentially less invasive ways to track how particular users hop from website to website. Temkin wrote in the blog post, though, that other methods like tracking people using identifiers from their email addresses â€œarenâ€™t a sustainable long term investment,â€ because they will not â€œmeet rising consumer expectations for privacy, nor will they stand up to rapidly evolving regulatory restrictions.â€ (These restrictions include the European Unionâ€™s General Data Protection Regulation, which dictates that users have to give their active consent to having cookies delivered to their browsers.) The big news on Wednesday is that Google wonâ€™t try to replace third-party cookies once theyâ€™re phased out with any sort of alternate individual identifiers for keeping tabs on users across the web.\nSo whatâ€™s Google going to do instead? Through the â€œPrivacy Sandbox,â€ an initiative to develop other, purportedly privacy-focused mechanisms for ad targeting, the company claims that itâ€™s found a number of promising solutions. For instance, Google has been testing targeting ads at groups of users with common interests, which would supposedly have the effect of hiding â€œindividuals within large crowds of people.â€ This method, known as â€œFederated Learning of Cohorts,â€ or FLoC, eschews the use of personally identifiable data and instead relies on machine-learning algorithms to aggregate thousands of people together based on online behaviors. The company is still collecting data, but on a broader, less individualized level. Google reported in a January post that, according to its testing, FLoC will allow businesses to get at least 95 percent of the ad interactions per dollar spent compared with what they would see with third-party cookies.\nGoogleâ€™s abandonment of tracking across websites doesnâ€™t mean that itâ€™s going to completely stop monitoring individualsâ€™ web behaviors, and it doesnâ€™t apply to phones running Android. In its announcement, the company said it will still support first-party relationships on its ad platforms. This refers to websites keeping track of what a visitor is doing within their domains, but not on other sites. The first-party data could allow a publisher using Googleâ€™s advertising platform to see that a certain user is reading a review for mini-fridges and will perhaps be more likely to interact with an ad for that product on the site.\nEven after these changes take place, we wonâ€™t live in a world where â€œtrackingâ€ on the web has stopped. But Googleâ€™s decision to do away with targeting based on interwebsite activity is a big deal largely because of the companyâ€™s outsize presence in the digital advertising industry. Google accounted for an estimated 52 percent of the worldâ€™s $292 billion worth of digital ad spending in 2020. Chrome had more than 60 percent of the worldâ€™s browser market share in February. Even slight changes to its advertising policies have consequences for millions of businesses; for instance, advertisers that were already trying to pursue email-based individual identifiers will now have to adjust their plans in order to jibe with Googleâ€™s move to abandon such identifiers altogether. When Google sneezes, the rest of the web just might get a cold."

And itâ€™s announcing today that it has raised $12 million in Series A funding.\nThe round was led by David Thacker at Greylock, with participation from Zynga founder Mark Pincus, Oculus founder Nate Mitchell and Cloudera founder Amr Awadallah, along with previous investors Upfront Ventures and Advancit Capital. Amy Chang, who sold her business intelligence startup Accompany to Cisco, is joining Pragmaâ€™s board of directors.\nCo-founder and CEO Eden Chen told me that where Unity and Unreal have built popular frontend game engines, he and his co-founder Chris Cobb (former engineering lead at Riot Games) are hoping Pragma will fill the void for a â€œde facto backend game engine.â€\nAnd while â€œmany companies tried to do thisâ€ over the past decade, Chen suggested that this is the right time to launch the platform, thanks to the continued rise of live service games (like League of Legends) that have to be treated as â€œliving, breathing products,â€ as well as improved tooling around infrastructure platforms like Amazon Web Services.\nPragma is launching a starter kit today designed to allow developers to quickly set up and test game loops. Meanwhile, the broader platform is currently in private beta testing with studios including One More Game (started by started by Pat Wyatt, one of Blizzardâ€™s first employees) and Mitchellâ€™s Mountain Top Studios.\nChen said the platformâ€™s features fall into three broad categories â€” player accounts/social, game loops (including lobbies and matchmaking) and player/game data. Pragma isnâ€™t building all of this from scratch; in some cases, itâ€™s â€œacting as the integratorâ€ for other platforms like Discord. Chen also noted that while the team plans to build a fully managed solution in the future, the current version is on-premise: â€œWeâ€™re building an instance of Pragma on the studioâ€™s own infrastructure, [so they can] so they can take our code base and customize it to their own preferences.â€\nPragma is initially targeting game studios with about 10 to 50 team members. Eventually, Chen hopes the platform could serve larger studios while also supporting â€œthe democratization of these tools, so that a one- to five-person team can really leverage [them] to launch a networked, online game.â€\nHe added, â€œThe vision for us long term is that we really want to be innovating on the social side, creating social features that improve the game and build stronger connections.â€"
